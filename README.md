# Days in a Month – PHP Application

## 📌 Description

This is a simple PHP web application that allows users to select a month from a dropdown list and displays the number of days in that month.

It includes static day counts for each month and a special note for **February**, explaining leap year behavior.

## 🛠 Features

- HTML form with month selection dropdown
- PHP logic to map months to day counts
- Message display with appropriate output
- Basic validation to ensure a month is selected

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Place `DaysInAMonth.php` in your local web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).
2. Start your server.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/DaysInAMonth.php` in your browser.
4. Choose a month from the dropdown and click **Go**.
5. The application will show the number of days in the selected month.

## 📝 Notes

- February always displays "28 days, if leap year 29" — leap year logic is mentioned but commented out in code.
- This is a basic educational project ideal for beginners learning PHP form handling.
